# My Plex HTPC Script Collection

This is a collection of my personal Plex HTPC scripts.

I'm not really a programmer, but kind of cobbled most of the stuff together and tweaked it with ChatGPT. Maybe the scripts are still helpful.

## Smart Deband

This script activates the deband function of mpv if the video is in H.264 8-bit format. In addition, you can add exceptions via whitelist and blacklist. Since mostly bad encodes or web rips are in H.264 8-bit, the debanding should only be applied to these videos.

## Smart Screenshot

With this script you can make 3 different types of screenshots.

1. Screenshots with visible subtitles
2. Screenshots without visible subtitles
3. Screenshots with visible subtitles and an overlay with the series name, episode number and timestamp
